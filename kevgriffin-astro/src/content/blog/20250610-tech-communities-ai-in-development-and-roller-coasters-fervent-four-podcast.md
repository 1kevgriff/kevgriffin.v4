  Last week I had the pleasure of being on the Fervent Four podcast with Zack
  Miller and Tim Ryan.  We talked about vibing coding and how AI needs to be
  handled the same way using offshore talent is handled.  We discussed roller
  coasters (because of course) and the origin of my Shedquarters!  And talked a
  lot also about the software development community in the Norfolk / Virginia
  Beach area.

Last week I had the pleasure of being on the Fervent Four podcast with [Zack Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zackmillersays/) and [Tim Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryantnt/).  We talked about vibing coding and how AI needs to be handled the same way using offshore talent is handled.  We discussed roller coasters (because of course) and the origin of my Shedquarters!  And talked a lot also about the software development community in the Norfolk / Virginia Beach area.

I'd love for you to watch and let me know what you think!
