# Roller Coaster Credits Review - Changes Summary

## Overview
Reviewed the coaster credits list for accuracy in count, location, and validity. Updated from **107** to **102** total credits after removing duplicates, non-coasters, and fixing errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Non-Coasters (2 removed)

**Universal's Islands of Adventure:**
- ❌ **Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey** - This is NOT a roller coaster. It's a dark ride using Kuka robotic arm technology with no traditional coaster track.
- ❌ **Pteranodon Flyers** - This is a suspended family ride, not a traditional roller coaster. Not typically counted by coaster enthusiasts.

### 2. Removed Duplicate/Converted Coasters (2 removed)

**Kings Dominion:**
- ❌ **Hurler** - This wooden coaster was converted into Twisted Timbers by RMC in 2018. It's the same structure, so only Twisted Timbers should be counted.

**Six Flags America:**
- ❌ **Roar** - This wooden coaster was converted into Firebird by RMC. It's the same structure (RMC conversion), so only Firebird should be counted.
- ❌ **Professor Sceamore's Skywinder** - Removed (this appears to be an error or non-existent coaster)

### 3. Fixed Spelling Errors

- **Grovers Alpine Express** → **Grover's Alpine Express** (added apostrophe)
- **Matterhorn Bobseld** → **Matterhorn Bobsleds** (fixed spelling)
- **Hagrid's Magical Creatures Moterbike Adventure** → **Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure** (fixed spelling)
- **Pterandon Flyers** → Removed (was misspelled, should be Pteranodon, but removed as not a true coaster)

### 4. Added Missing Information

- **Cedar Point** - Added location: (Sandusky, Ohio)
- **Motorworld** - Added "1 Coaster" label for consistency with other sections

### 5. Updated Counts

- **Total Credits:** 107 → **102** (-5 coasters)
- **Kings Dominion:** 16 → **15** (-1: removed Hurler)
- **Universal's Islands of Adventure:** 6 → **4** (-2: removed Forbidden Journey and Pteranodon Flyers)
- **Six Flags America:** 7 → **5** (-2: removed Roar and Professor Sceamore's Skywinder)

## Notes on Coasters Still Listed (But Potentially Questionable)

The following coasters remain in the list but may warrant discussion:

### Defunct Coasters Still Listed:
- **Big Bad Wolf** (Busch Gardens Williamsburg) - Closed 2009
- **Drachen Fire** (Busch Gardens Williamsburg) - Closed 1998
- **Wild Maus** (Busch Gardens Williamsburg) - Status unclear
- **Hypersonic XLC** (Kings Dominion) - Closed 2007
- **Shockwave** (Kings Dominion) - Closed 2015
- **Volcano: The Blast Coaster** (Kings Dominion) - Closed 2018

*These were kept as they represent historical credits - coasters the rider has experienced even if they're no longer operating.*

### Borderline Cases:
- **Blazing Fury** (Dollywood) - Primarily a dark ride with a brief coaster section, but commonly counted
- **Camelback Mountain Coaster** - Mountain coasters are sometimes debated but generally accepted

### Name Clarifications:
- **Avalanche (Reptilian)** at Kings Dominion - Same coaster, renamed in 2017
- **Space Mountain (Alpha/Omega)** at Magic Kingdom - These track names were used before 2009 rebuild

## Final Count: 102 Coaster Credits

All section counts have been verified to match the actual number of coasters listed.
