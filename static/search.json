First, HangFire's setup process is extremely straightforward - I need to install the NuGet package and do a bit of configuration. Second, HangFire allows me to use my existing code, thus reducing any dependency on specific vendors and increasing the flexibility of my applications. The third factor I appreciate is the user-friendly dashboard of HangFire, which provides a clear and concise overview of all my running, failed, and scheduled jobs. Fourth, HangFire simplifies the process of scheduling and creating recurring jobs, offering flexible configurations to suit my needs. Lastly, HangFire's error management system is commendable. It attempts to run a job multiple times if it fails, making my debugging process significantly more efficient. I also introduce my new course on HangFire in the article, aiming to help others improve the performance and scalability of their .NET applications using this remarkable tool."},{"title":"HttpContext Issues with Azure SignalR Service","path":"/httpcontext-issues-azure-signalr-service/","summary":"During my recent project where I migrated an ASP.NET Core application to Azure SignalR Service, I encountered a notable issue with HttpContext. In standard ASP.NET SignalR setups, I could easily access HttpContext via IHttpContextAccessor in my Hub class. This approach had been working flawlessly for me for years. However, after the migration to Azure SignalR Service, I noticed that IHttpContextAccessor didn't provide the same level of information. This change is understandable, considering the connection in Azure SignalR Service is between the client and Azure, rather than directly to my server's hub. To adapt, I shifted my strategy to directly pass essential data, such as timezone information, from the client to the hub. This method of passing parameters directly turned out to be a more efficient solution. Additionally, I appreciated how Azure SignalR Service manages IPrincipal information from HttpContext, which is useful for identity management using the Context.User property. This experience was a valuable addition to my ongoing journey of mastering evolving technologies in the .NET and Azure ecosystems."},{"title":"Azure Functions: No bindings were found in the function $func","path":"/azure-function-no-bindings-found-in-function/","summary":"How do you resolve a 'No bindings were found in the function $func' error when using Azure Functions?"},{"title":"Hampton Roads DevFest 2024 Retrospective","path":"/hampton-roads-devfest-2024-retrospective/","summary":"On May 31st, 2024, Hampton Roads DevFest successfully re-engaged the local developer community in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with 183 attendees.

Iâ€™ve always loved Azure Functions for their affordability, simplicity, and ability to scale with demand, making them perfect for handling background tasks like processing queues. But I learned the hard way that scaling can spiral out of control, especially when using Elastic Premium instances with constant back pressure. What started as a cost-effective solution ballooned into a costly oversight as Azure ramped up resources to handle the load. After this experience, I realized not every problem is a serverless problem and shifted memory-intensive tasks to Azure Container Apps, which provided better control over resources. Itâ€™s a painful but important reminder to understand cloud scaling and pricing before letting workloads run wild."},{"title":"Tech Communities, AI in Development and Roller Coasters | Fervent Four Podcast","path":"/permalink/","summary":"Last week I had the pleasure of being on the Fervent Four podcast with Zack Miller and Tim Ryan.
