<p>After giving a talk, it’s really difficult to judge if you reached any of the attendee’s.&#160; Normally, you get the occasional “good job” or “thanks, that was a big help.”&#160; Today I got a small mention by Johnathan Bracken, who was sitting in my <strong>jQuery From The Ground Up</strong> talk at Roanoke Code Camp.&#160; This means a lot, because it shows that my talk stayed in Johnathan’s head past the end of the talk.&#160; </p>  <p>He just started blogging, and mentioned me in his entry <em>I Will Not Run from JavaScript No More</em> (since removed). </em>This is very cool to see.&#160; I wish Johnathan the best of luck in his jQuery adventures!&#160; And I expect him to give a jQuery talk at next year’s code camp.</p>
