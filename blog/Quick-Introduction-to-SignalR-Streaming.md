For my entry this year for [C# Advent](https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/The-Second-Annual-C-Advent), I wanted to do something a little bit different.

As of late, I've been wanting to start doing several tidbits around cool things that I see in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.  And by the recommendation of my friend, [Brady Gaster](https://twitter.com/bradygaster), I took a look at the new Streaming APIs built into SignalR (for ASP.NET Core).  

And WOW!  I'm super impressed with that I saw.  

Check out my video introduction below, and lemme know what you think in the comments!
