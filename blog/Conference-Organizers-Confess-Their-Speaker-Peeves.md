As a [conference organizer](https://revolutionconf.com), I try to be very receptive to what the industry is saying. And occasionally, some speakers like to publish articles on how they feel conference organizers can improve on their already difficult jobs of running conferences.

But yet, nobody really calls out the speakers on what they can do to improve.

So I went to Twitter, and asked a pretty harmless question:

https://twitter.com/1kevgriff/status/1233152682036269056

The results were pretty amazing - and I want to share the results of this questionnaire with you.  Even better, I've tried to organize the comments based off the conference lifecycle.

**Disclaimer**

_I have taken an immense amount of time reviewing the feedback provided in the Twitter thread.  I have selected multiple comments because they have been mentioned more than once, by different organizers, for different events, in different countries all around the world.  I will never single out a particular speaker or group of speakers.  All this information is provided for constructive feedback._

## CFP
Most conferences begin with the CFP, or the Call for Papers.  It is also commonly referred to as the Call for Speakers.  This laborious procedure occurs as conferences open up the doors for any potential speakers to submit their talks for consideration within the conference schedule.

### Have Your Read the CFP?
When the CFP is released, it generally includes a lot of really useful information.

In particular, the CFP will probably tell you what the central focus of the conference is and the type of people that will be in attendance.  You can use this information to frame talks that will be beneficial towards the goal of the conference and increases your likelihood of being selected.

To the same extent, a CFP will often provide a travel policy as to if the conference can cover travel and expense costs for selected speakers.

With all this great information, several conference organizers told me they wished speakers would read the CFP before submitting an abstract.

"But Kevin, I did read the CFP..."

Of course, you did!  But fellow conference organizers tell me they typically spend a lot of brainpower answering speaker questions that are easily covered by the CFP.  

So maybe a better piece of advice is to double-check the CFP before asking a question.  Just in case?

### Reviewing the Travel Policy
Long the same lines as reading the CFP, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the events "official" travel policy is.  CFPs that provide travel and expense coverage will often dictate this in very clear terms.  

Sometimes the policy is vague - with reason.  For RevolutionConf (my conference), we will often make a promise, such as the hotel is covered 100% for 2 nights, but additional travel expenses will be approved on a case-by-case basis.

Other conferences might specify "we only cover travel for speakers traveling within North America".

It's okay to email the conference with clarifying questions.  Please do that.  However, please do not submit to the conference that only covers travel within North America and then request full flight coverage from South Sudan.  You're going to put the organizer in an awkward spot if they're not able to accomodate.

### Titles and Abstracts
My intention here is not to advise you on how to write a winning title and abstract for a conference.  There are entire books and Twitter threads on this topic. 

However, conference organizers have some feedback for you.

First, the title of your talk should not be longer than your abstract.  During review processes, it is common for only titles to be glanced at.  A good title will get you an abstract review.  A long title might get you passed over.
