Today, I am officially launching my new course, SignalR Mastery!  

I've been training professional for ten years, and over that time I've built a variety of courses for many course platforms in our industry.  They've been great to work with, but I always felt disconnected from the students taking those courses.

This time around, I wanted to build a course **my way**.  I wanted to have a platform where students could give me direct feedback and where I could directly interact with them to ensure their success.  Udemy has proven to be one of the many excellent providers out there where I could do exactly that.

> You're buying a course.  Buy once, enjoy the growth of the course forever.  No silly subscriptions.

What subject should I do the course on?  I decided it was time to revisit one of my favorite libraries in the ASP.NET stack, SignalR.  I've been talking about SignalR for better part of 7 years since it was released in 2013.  I've integrated it successfully into dozens of client applications.  It's a fun tech to demo!  

SignalR Mastery was born!  It's my new approach to teaching.  Each video in the series has me directly working with you to learn a new subject.  I've worked hard to remove all the fluff.  The context needed to learn a topic or facet of SignalR has been minimized.

What's the course about? [See the full course outline, including upcoming bits.](https://www.udemy.com/course/signalr-mastery/learn/?referralCode=5F129296A976F8353B79)  Here is the synopsis:

> The web isn't static.  As more and more people live and work on the internet, developers need to make an effort to build robust, adaptive applications that can keep up with the fast pace of business.

> In the 2000s, it was perfectly acceptable for a page to be static.  Imagine you're working with a product inventory application.  Are other people working against the same data?  Can you be sure the current price of the product is valid?  Did it change?  How would you even know?  Refresh the page to load updated data and see. 

> What if the page could... update itself?  In real-time?  

> Once upon a time, this was a complicated solution to implement in a performant manner.  Today, it's as simple as creating a WebSocket!  

> How do you manage thousands or millions of WebSockets across multiple servers?  Reliably?  What if the environment cannot support a WebSocket connection?  What do you fall back to?

> SignalR is a library for .NET which allows developers to add real-time capabilities to their applications.  It provides a framework for managing connections from various clients, including web pages, mobile apps, desktop applications, and more.  It handles all of the grunt work.

> In this course, we'll take a structured look at how SignalR works and how you can harness it within your .NET applications.  

I couldn't have done it without the amazing support of my friends and family!  Building these types of courses are not for the weak of heart, and we're just getting started.

I hope you enjoy the course!
