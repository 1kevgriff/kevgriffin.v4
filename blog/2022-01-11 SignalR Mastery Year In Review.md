Today marks the one year anniversary of my course, `SignalR Mastery`, which I launched on Udemy on January 11th, 2021.

I've been completely open on the developmnet and management of this course with friends in private, but I feel that after a year in, I should be open with the community on what I've picked up building and supporting this course.

## Why Udemy?  

First, a little background.  This isn't my first video course.  I've developed several over the past ten years, for a variety of the biggest publishers out there in the technology community.  The folks I worked with at all those companies have been professional, and a joy to work with.  

However, when you work for a larger company, there are typically pre-determined processes they want you to abide by.  Module or lesson structure.  Time lengths.  Demos structure.  Everything in between.  You do not typically get much flexibility in how a course should be presented to a student.

I've done a SignalR course before.  It was a lot of fun and an amazing learning experience.

But I wanted much more flexibility over the complete course.  Everything from what topics I discuss, how I discuss them, and the length of the discussions would be.  If I want to talk about the different ways to cover client filtering in SignalR, and that takes 5 minutes, it should take 5 minutes.  Many companies would ask or require a minimum of a 15 minute long segment.  That's not useful to you as the student.

So where do you go?

I could've self-hosted the course through something like Teachable or Gumroad.  And goodness, I could've charged five the amount of money.
