Today marks the one year anniversary of my course, `SignalR Mastery`, which I launched on Udemy on January 11th, 2021.

I've been completely open on the developmnet and management of this course with friends in private, but I feel that after a year in, I should be open with the community on what I've picked up building and supporting this course.

## Why Udemy?  

First, a little background.  This isn't my first video course.  I've developed several over the past ten years, for a variety of the biggest publishers out there in the technology community.  The folks I worked with at all those companies have been professional, and a joy to work with.  

However, when you work for a larger company, there are typically pre-determined processes they want you to abide by.  Module or lesson structure.  Time lengths.  Demos structure.  Everything in between.  You do not typically get much flexibility in how a course should be presented to a student.

Heck - I've done a SignalR course before.  It was a lot of fun and an amazing learning experience.

But I wanted much more flexibility over the complete course.  Everything from what topics I discuss, how I discuss them, and the length of the discussions would be.  If I want to talk about the different ways to cover client filtering in SignalR, and that takes 5 minutes, it should take 5 minutes.  Many companies would ask or require a minimum of a 15 minute long segment.  That's not useful to you as the student.

So where do you go?

I could've self-hosted the course through something like Teachable or Gumroad.  And goodness, I could've charged five times the amount of money.  

But I'm no Scott Hanselman.  

Getting the course out in front of a willing audience is key to success!

My friend, Bret Fisher, found a lot of success with his Docker Mastery course by hosting it on Udemy.  Publishing a course on Udemy is pretty low risk, because as the author, I retain 100% of the rights to it.  Nobody controls the course layout, the content, or how often I choose to make updates.

But Udemy severely limits the amount of money you make from a course.  Depending on when you look at the landing page my course could nine dollars or seventeen dollars.  If you buy directly from [https://signalrmastery.com](signalrmastery.com), I get roughly 95% of the amount.  But other promotions or affiliates could see me making less than 10%.  It varies.

But the Udemy marketplace opens up easily thousands of potential students that I wouldn't have otherwise have had access to.  So yes, I could've sold the course for more money - but would I have MADE more money?

## Why SignalR?  

SignalR is not the type of technology that folks are googling for daily.  It's not getting BUILD keynotes or presentations at .NET Conf (believe me, I've tried).

But SignalR is definitely one of those technologies are as super useful in daily application, and very few people know how to use it intelligently.  As a consultant, I've worked with dozens of clients on how to best utilize SignalR.  It's always full of "oh, I didn't know you could do that moments."

My previous SignalR course was syntax and some design, but I couldn't really go into the detail I wanted on issues that real teams have to face.

This course was syntax, design, and real-world experiences with SignalR.  This was a topic I could talk about at length, on demand, anytime.  Building the course was simply ceremony.  The content practically wrote itself!  

## Metrics  

How about some numbers?  At the time of this writing SignalR Mastery has 1799 students and has made a little over $6,300.  

I know what you might be thinking: Kevin... that's all??

Well, yes.  The course has made about six thousand dollars (US), but I also have made over $30,000 from consulting engagement leads from the course.  The riches are in the niches, as they like to say!

## Would I Do It Again?  

Yes.  100%.

SignalR Mastery has been a ton of fun to build.  The students ask awesome, engaging questions.  I've learn a ton myself just supporting the students.  And I think most teachers will tell you they learn the most from their students.  It's simply because everything I know if from my experiences, and that's a narrow, limited view.  Students help in expanding my horizons by changing my view of how things should work.  Not knowing the answer to a question is the best!

## Next steps

SignalR Mastery is due for some updates, and those are coming up in the next month or two.  I have **several** ideas for new courses that I want to do, and I'm excited to get started on the next big thing.
