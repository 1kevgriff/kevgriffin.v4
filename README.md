Notes

 - Based on my [personal portfolio website](https://andremadarang.com). I wanted to create an open source version with more features.
 - Check out a [screencast I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHo6o1TNQeE) where I go through the process of building my website.
 - Illustrations from [unDraw](https://undraw.co)
 - Check out these other Gridsome Starters where I got some ideas from:
    - [Gridsome Starter Blog](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog)
    - [Gridsome Starter Bleda](https://github.com/cossssmin/gridsome-starter-bleda)
    - [Jigsaw Starter Blog](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/starter-templates/) - I got a lot of design inspiration from this starter theme.
