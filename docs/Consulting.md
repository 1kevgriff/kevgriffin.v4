I am actively available to short term consulting engagements.  
What are some ways that we can engage with each other?

### ASP.NET Core Architecture and Implementation

As a 10-time Microsoft MVP, my primary focus and enjoyment comes from designing and implementing solutions built on top of ASP.NET Core. I have worked with several clients to modernize their applicaitons on ASP.NET Core, as I feel it is one of the best solutions on the market for building and maintaining scalable, flexible, and performant web applications.

### Microsoft Azure Architecture and Implementation

In the current age of cloud-based applications, it is important to choose a provider that will ensure your applications and services are running at top performance - all the time. For over ten years, I have supported clients on top of Microsoft Azure. I would love to work with your team to design or implement a strategy for adding Microsoft Azure to your technical stack.

### Web Development Architecture and Implementation

In addition to the work I've done on building scalable ASP.NET Core applications, I have spent a good amount of time building and improving web applications. While I'm currently in love with Vue.JS, I'm well versed in other client side technologies such as React and Angular. Heck, if you want to go old-school, I loved me some jQuery back in the 2000's.

### Application Modernization

If you stop and blink, technology is changing before your eyes! I have worked with several clients on modernization projects to bring their tech stacks forward to something that is maintainable for the next several years.

### Performance Optimization

Another core aspect of the consulting work I've done is focused on performance. Sometimes it's easy to lose track of the bigger picture when developing application, and before you know it your servers are pegged and pages take minutes to load.
