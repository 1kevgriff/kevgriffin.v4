### Mastering SignalR

> SignalR is an ASP.NET library for building real-time, two-way Web applications that support server-to-client communications as well as client-to-server communications. Under the hood, it uses HTML5 WebSockets for bidirectional communications, but it also works without WebSockets. Whether youâ€™re building a chat application, a real-time game, or anything else that requires two-way communications between a Web browser and a Web server, SignalR abstracts away the underlying protocol and reduces two-way communications to a few simple function calls. Take a ride on the SignalR train as Kevin Griffin takes you step by step through the library and its features.
